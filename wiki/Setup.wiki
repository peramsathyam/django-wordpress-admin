  # Copy wordpress folder into your project (it is a standalone app)
  # Point your project's settings.py to your WordPress database.
  # Run the database migration script: {{{ mysql -u MYSQLUSER -p MYSQLDB < migrate_db.sql
  # {{{manage.py syncdb}}}

NB: The database migration script clones a couple of tables and columns so they can be utilized in Django. It should not prevent your database from continuing to be used in WordPress.
